                This is a website made by Rudhra Raveendran, Gavin Mays, Sam Neil, and Serge Piskun for extra credit in Mrs. Mills' 2015-2016 AP Physics class. It contains notes from the textbook, particularly from sections 2.1 through 2.5, showing that we really did pay attention. One could possibly use this webpage as a teaching or review tool for their future students. Perhaps... This was definitely not done the night before. We promise.

Even Gravity Waves! And, because all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, we added some links to some physics related games as well. Enjoy!

              The basic stuff. You need to learn how to do these things if you ever want to be good at physics.

              <h5 id="motion">Motion</h5>
              In the study of motion, items are described as a particle, as in they only represent one point. Motion is described as the change in the particle's position over time.
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Average Velocity:</strong> A vector quantity whose x-component is the change in x decided by the time interval. In other words, the average velocity is the difference in x values for two locations divided by the time it took to go between those locations.</li>
                <li>Δx = x2 - x1</li>
                <li>V avg = (x2 - x1)/(t2 - t1)</li>
                <li>When the particle is moving in the +x-direction the V avg is positive.</li>
                <li>When the particle is moving in the -x-direction the V avg is negative.</li>
                <li>When an object makes a trip and ends the trip at its starting location (ie: driving to a place and back to your start) the total displacement is zero so the average velocity is zero.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                If a particle moves in a negative x-direction the velocity will be negative. In straight-line notation the Δx is displacement and V avg is simply average velocity.
              </p>
              
              <h5 id="graph">X-T Graph</h5>
              <p>
                An <strong>X-T Graph</strong> contains position (x) and time (t). The green line’s slope represents the average velocity. The tangent line (unique to any point on the graph) represents the instantaneous velocity (speed at that one point in time).

              <h4>2.2 Instantaneous Velocity</h4>
              <strong>Instantaneous Velocity</strong> is the velocity at any specific instant of time or specific point along a path (speed and direction). Usually “instant” refers to “very fast” but in physics “instant” has no duration. Instead it refers to a single value of time.

                <li>The instantaneous velocity is written as Δx/Δt as both approach 0. This is also called the derivative of x written as dx/dt.</li>
                <li>The term “velocity” refers to instantaneous rather than average velocity unless specified</li>

              <p>
               <strong>Speed</strong> denotes distance traveled divided by time. The symbol v with no subscript denotes instantaneous speed, measuring how fast a particle is moving. Instantaneous speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity so it can never be negative.

              <blockquote>
                On a graph of positions as a function of time for a straight-line motion, the instantaneous velocity at any point is equal to the slope of the tangent to the curve at that point.

              <h4>2.3 Average and Instantaneous Acceleration</h4>
              <strong>Average Acceleration</strong> is a vector quantity whose x-component is change in the x-component of velocity, divided by the y-component, the time interval (change in time). <strong>Instantaneous Acceleration</strong> is the limit of the average acceleration as the time interval approaches zero. The instantaneous acceleration equals the instantaneous rate of change of velocity with time.

              Galileo thought bodies should fall with a downward acceleration that is constant and independent of body weight. This was true.

                <li>If the distance of the fall is small compared to the radius of the earth, the acceleration is constant.</li>
                <li><strong>Free Fall:</strong> the idealized model that neglects the effects of air, the earth’s rotation, and decrease of acceleration with increasing altitude.</li>
                <li><strong>Acceleration due to gravity</strong> is the constant acceleration of a freely falling body (denoted as “g” it is equal to 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>)</li>
                <li>g is always positive and will change if the gravity for a planet changes.</li>
