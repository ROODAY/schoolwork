                <h1>Amenhotep III</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amenhotep III, the ninth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty was arguably the greatest of the Egyptian Pharaohs. His forty-year reign brought about an unprecedented period of prosperity and stability, and brought Egypt to the height of its power in a veritable golden age. By using diplomacy and friendship, tactics hitherto unseen in any ancient correspondence, Amenhotep III was able to control his fellow rulers in the Near East with gold instead of bronze.</p><br>

                <h1>General Reign</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amenhotep III was born around 1388 BCE, to Thutmose IV and Queen Mutemwiya. He was crowned pharaoh when he was but a child, most likely between the ages of 6 and 12. As a child is not fit to rule, a regent acted for him until he was old enough to take the helm as pharaoh. Two years after his coronation he was married to Tiye, the daughter of the powerful nobles Yuya and Tuya, who became his queen and chief wife. Later on in his reign he fathered two sons: Thutmose and Amenhotep IV, the former of which died was planned to succeed him but died young. He also fathered four daughters: Sitamun, Henuttanem, Isis, and Nebetah. During the last decade of his rule, Amenhotep III declared Sitamun and Isis as great royal wives.</p><br>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amenhotep III’s reign was one of the most peaceful times in Egypt, as there is only one recorded military activity under his rule. Near Aswan and Sai Island in Nubia are three stelas which commemorate his victory with the exaggeration typically used by pharaohs. The stelas tell of how Amenhotep crushed a rebellion at Kush, arriving like a falcon and demolishing his enemies with the ferocity of a lion. While the actual battle was undoubtedly nowhere near as glorious as he made it out to be, propaganda like the stelas greatly increased his popularity and allowed him to maintain control of his empire.</p>

                <h1>Diplomatic Achievements</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reign of Amenhotep III was a golden age for Egypt, in every sense of the term. Preserved correspondences, known as the Amarna Letters, between him and other rulers document how he would give gold and gifts to them, and would receive gifts in kind. The clay tablets archive the diplomatic talks between Amenhotep and the kings of nearby Assyria, Mitanni, Babylon, and Hatti, and are even more distinctive in that they were written in Akkadian cuneiform as opposed to Egyptian hieroglyphics. The most famous of the Amarna letters is a correspondence between Amenhotep III and the Babylonian king Kadashman-Enlil I, in which the Egyptian Pharaoh refused to allow any Egyptian woman to marry a foreign king, even though Amenhotep III himself married many daughters of the nearby kings. This refusal by Amenhotep was most likely due to the fact that if any princess of his married an outsider, there would be claims to his throne, and such an event would disturb his carefully crafted equilibrium.</p><br>

                <h1>Monuments and Temples</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amenhotep III is special in that he has the most surviving statues of any Egyptian pharaoh, with over 250 of his statues having been discovered to date. His reign is also marked with a series of over 200 ceremonial stone scarabs that have been found from Syria to Nubia. The scarabs extolled his accomplishments and acted as the first newspaper system in history. Many of the scarabs tell of the countless lions Amenhotep III slew in order to elevate his greatness, others would state which foreign princess he would marry, and even others record the creation of an artificial lake he built just for his chief wife, Queen Tiye.</p><br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amenhotep also built many monuments, particularly at the Temple of Karnak. There he created the third pylon of the Temple of Karnak, and at modern Luxor he created the Temple of Amun. The temple consisted of two pylons, structures made of two tapering towers connected by an elevated entrance, and included reliefs depicting the birth of Amenhotep III directly from the god Amun. The reliefs legitimized his sovereignty, proclaiming that he truly was the descendant of a god and had the right to rule. Amenhotep also built a new temple for the goddess Ma’at, and later broke down the fourth pylon of the Temple of Amun in order to create a pylon within another temple, a common practice for pharaohs. Amenhotep initiated the construction of the Hypostyle hall, which had reliefs depicting his coronation by the gods. Before his death, he had a massive mortuary temple constructed on the west bank of the Nile, and it was the largest religious complex in Thebes at the time. However, the complex was too close to the floodplain and was reduced to ruins within two centuries, and future pharaohs repurposed much of its masonry for other projects. The Colossi of Memnon, two eighteen meter high statues of Amenhotep, guarded the entrance to his temple, and are the only parts of the temple that haven’t been destroyed.</p>

                <h1>Later Life</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his later years, and early into the reign of his son Akhenaten, Amenhotep III likely shared power with him in a co-regency. Although the co-regency is merely a theory currently postulated by historians, evidence is found in a letter from the nearby Mitannian king during Akhenaten’s reign, in which the king complains to Amenhotep that Akhenaten did not pay the dowry for his daughter. In addition, evidence from the tomb of a Vizier known as Amenhotep-Huy further confirms that Amenhotep III shared power with his son, at least for a short time. Closer to his death, Amenhotep was believed to have been very weak and plagued by arthritis. Art inside the temple of Soleb in Nubia depict Amenhotep as visibly sick, and Amenhotep even requested a statue of Ishtar, a healing goddess, from his father in law in Mitanni. However, around that time Amenhotep was marrying another wife, and so some speculate that the statue was brought in for the wedding ceremony.</p><br>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his death, Amenhotep III was buried in the Western Valley of the Valley of the Kings, and sometime during the Third Intermediate Period his body was moved into a side chamber with several other pharaohs. When he died, he left Egypt in the height of its power, but intimately tied to traditional values. Because of this, when his son Akhenaten eventually made his radical changes, the country was shaken to its core. Amenhotep III’s reign cemented Egypt as the regional superpower, and ushered in an age of peace and prosperity. He truly was one of the great pharaohs of ancient Egypt.</p>
