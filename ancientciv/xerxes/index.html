                <h1>Xerxes I The Great</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xerxes I the Great, the successor of Darius I, was one of the most widely remembered ancient kings. He made Amestris, daughter of Otanes, his wife, and fathered Amytis, Artaxerxes I, Darius, Hystaspes, Achaemenes, and Rhodogune. And by continuing the Persian Wars started by his father, Darius I, Xerxes forever immortalized himself for both his victories, and ultimately, his failure. But to better understand the god-king, one must understand his past.</p>

                <h1>Early Life</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xerxes’ father and mother were Darius I and Atossa, daughter of Cyrus the Great, respectively. When a revolt in Egypt erupted, his father Darius was forced to prepare his tomb and appoint Xerxes as his successor before setting out on the expedition. The incident was known as the Ionian Revolt, and involved the burning of the Persian city of Sardis, provoking Darius into beginning the Persian Wars. After Darius’ death in 486 BCE, Artabazanes, the eldest son of Darius, claimed the crown, as it was the established tradition for the eldest to succeed. However, Xerxes claimed the crown due to the fact he was the son of Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus, and since Cyrus had won the Persians their freedom, he should be the rightful ruler. Some scholars believe this is why Xerxes was given the throne, although another theory postulates that although Artabazanes was the eldest son, he was born before Darius became king, therefore making Xerxes the eldest in terms of royalty.</p><br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xerxes was officially crowned king of Persia in late 486 BCE, when he was approximately 36 years old. Due to the great authority of his mother Atossa, the transition of power went unchallenged by anyone in the court or the Achaemenian family, allowing him to immediately crush revolts in Egypt and Babylon. After dealing with the insurgencies, he appointed his brother Achaemenes as satrap of Egypt. Soon after, in 484 BCE, he provoked the Babylonians by forcibly taking and destroying their golden statue of Marduk, a terrible offense to the Babylonians, whose king was mandated by tradition to clasp the hands of the statue each New Year’s Day. This outrage led to a Babylonian rebellion, in which Xerxes was no longer referred to as the king of Babylon in any of their documents from then on.</p>

                <h1>Start of the Persian Wars</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xerxes most important endeavors occurred during the Persian Wars, when he resumed the battles after a few years of mourning his father. Xerxes began his efforts by attempting to constrict a bridge across the Hellespont, the results of which were later known as Xerxes’ Pontoon Bridges. According to accounts from the Greek Herodotus, Xerxes’ first bridge failed, as it was destroyed in a storm. In a fit of anger, he ordered his men to whip the river itself three hundred times. Coincidentally, his next attempt succeeded without incident. Xerxes then ended an alliance with Carthage, depriving Greece help from the nations of Syracuse and Agrigentum. Not only did the Greeks suffer from that, smaller Greek states joined the Persians, namely Thessaly, Thebes, and Argos.</p><br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spring of 480 BCE, Xerxes started towards Greece from Sardis with a fleet and army, estimated to be nearly one million strong by Herodotus, and supposedly included 10,000 elite warriors known as the Persian Immortals. Modern estimations of Xerxes’ forces put them at around 60,000 soldiers, as the rough and arid terrain of the battlefields could not have supported such a large number of fighters. </p>

                <h1>Battles of the Persian Wars</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first battle that Xerxes oversaw was the Battle of Thermopylae, arguably the most famous of all the battles in the Persian Wars. The battle was fought by the massive Persian forces and a comparatively tiny force of three hundred Greek Spartans, and their king Leonidas. The Spartans initially held off the Persians by funneling them through a narrow corridor, but were ultimately defeated when the Persians were informed of a pass through the mountains by the Greek Ephialtes. After the victory at Thermopylae, Xerxes captured the city of Athens, and burnt it down, according to Herodotus.</p><br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dealing with Athens, Xerxes made a foolish mistake by sending his fleet to attack the Greeks under unfavorable conditions, instead of waiting for the dissolution of the Greek forces. This was what the Greek general Themistocles had wanted, and this pushed the Persians into a battle that they weren’t prepared for. Thus began the Battle of Salamis, in September, 480 BCE. The Persian ships sailed into the Straits of Salamis, attempting to block the entrances. Due to their large numbers, however, the Persians didn’t have enough space to maneuver, and were promptly defeated. After losing when he expected a decisive victory, Xerxes retreated to Asia with a large portion of his army, leaving his commander Mardonius to finish the war. At around the same time, civil unrest began in Babylon, forcing Xerxes to send his army home to prevent a revolt, and with so few soldiers, Mardonius was defeated the following year at the battle of Plataea. After the Battle of Plataea started, but before its end, the Battle of Mycale occurred when the Greeks attacked and destroyed the remaining Persian fleet anchored at the location. Soon after, the Plataea concluded with a Persian loss, and the Persian Wars ended.</p>

                <h1>Later Life</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his failures in Greece, Xerxes returned home to oversee the completion of many projects that his father never finished. These included the Gate of All Nations and the Hall of a Hundred Columns at Persepolis, which were the most impressive features of the entire palace. Xerxes also completed the Apadana (a large audience hall), the Palace of Darius, and the Treasury, all works that were originally started by Darius I. Xerxes even had a palace twice the size of his father’s constructed, and completed the Susa gate. Xerxes’ taste for architecture closely resembled that of Darius, only on a grander scale, made evident by the massive palaces he had constructed in many major cities.</p><br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 465 BCE, Xerxes’ reign was cut short when he was murdered by Artabanus, the commander of the royal bodyguard and, at the time, the most powerful man in all the Persian court. There are two accounts of the subsequent events, however. One claims that Artabanus killed Xerxes, then accused Xerxes’ eldest son Darius of the murder, and persuaded Xerxes’ other son Artaxerxes to avenge his father. Another account, by Aristotle, claims that Artabanus killed Darius, then Xerxes, and then he and his sons were killed by Artaxerxes. No matter which report is true, the Achaemenids continued to keep power over the throne with the help of Persian General Megabyzus.</p>
