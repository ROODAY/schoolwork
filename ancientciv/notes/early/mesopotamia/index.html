                <p>
                    Mud was essential for early agriculture, particularly in the developing civilizations in Mesopotamia. The mud from the overflowing rivers of ther Tigris and Euphrates provided fertile soil, and also doubled as a pretty good material for buildings, such as warehouses, temples, and homes. Early Mesopotamians would cut the mud into bricks and dried them outside in the sun (in the future kilns were used). Once the mud bricks were in a usable form, they would be used for pretty much any building structure they needed. Mud (not the bricks) was also used for pottery, which were mainly used for containing grain and crops. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Fertile Crescent was perfect for the cultivation of the versatile and hardy barley, which was used for wine, bread and cereal. The climate also suited the date palm, whose oil was used for a variety of things, ranging from preservative, to seasoning, to lubricant. ಠ‿↼

                <p>
                    Although there were other areas that supported a similar range of crops, Mesopotamia thrived due to its excellent irrigation system. The Tigris and Euphrates rivers had natural rivulets that spread throughout the region. The inhabitants of the area simply improved upon what nature provided, creating complex systems of locks that moved water where and when they needed it.

                    The first animal to be domesticated was the dog, or rather the wolf, around 11,000 BCE. Modern dogs are selectively bred descendants of the first domesticated wolves. Humans simply chose to breed the wolves that looked nice to them, and that led to the species of dogs we have today. Some time after dogs came the domestication of other barnyard animals, such as donkeys, geese, ducks, chickens, pigs, and sheep. With all these animals for food, clothing, and protection, the idea of surplus was born.

                <h2>Significance of Surplus</h2>
                <p>
                    Having a surplus of food, or having more than what was necessary, humans had more free time than their ancestors. With this time, came the developmenmts of early civilizations. The first basic part of a civilization to come about was the city, a place of commerce, cultural diffusion, resources, and a political seat of power. Early examples include Catal Huyuk, Jericho, Ur/Uruk, and Babylon.

                <h2>Aspects of Early Cities</h2>
                <p>
                    Early cities had a central government that was in control of the organization, defense, commerce, and religion of its people. Specifically on the last bit, religion had already reached a fairly complex point by this time. Kings doubled as priests, the gateway to god for the common people. Because of this, there was basically no separation between church and state, they were regarded as the same, and the word of god was law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cities also were characterized by job specialization, another benefit of the surplus. Without needing everyone to be hunters or gatherers, people could choose to become good at one thing and be known for it. However, this specialization also led to the ideas of social classes and hierarchy. For the majority of ancient history, the hierarchy followed a pretty basic pattern, with peasants and slaves occupying the bottom, superceded by special/skilled workers, then nobles/rich/priests, then ultimately the king/priest-king. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most important part of cities in relation to ancient history was the development of written language. Although it was initially used just for commercial purposes such as keeping track of inventory and past transactions, it evolved into a system of preserving histories and culture, allowing us to study civilizations from all those millenia ago. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cities also saw the flourishing of art and architecture, which allowed people to express their beliefs and values, intimidate and/or impress their visitors, and also for the use of public works. The last category spanned a wide range, from roads, bridges and canals to schools, libraries and even primitive hospitals. Public works also encompassed the idea of safety through an army/police force.

                <p>
                    A quick briefing on the Code of Hammurabi: It tells us that social class would determine the punishment for a criminal, i.e. the higher up you are, the less severe the punishment. It also tells us that ancient civilizations, at least those that followed the laws of Hammurabi, believed in personal accountability, that one must be responsible for their actions. The difference between ancient accountability and ours is that if you screwed up back then, you'd die.

                    Mesopotamia is a geographical location, coming from the Greek to mean land between two rivers. The major kingdoms of Mesopotamia existed between 3000 BCE and 539 BCE, with four very important ones. During this time period, civilizations were manifested as city states, each one agriculturally based, getting their power from the land, having a unified church and state with a priest-king, and having a military noble to maintain order. The social hierarchy of these city states had the priest-king at the top, followed by the warrior nobility, then the scribes, craftsmen and artisans, and finally the unlanded, menial laborers such as peasants and slaves. The urban center of these civilizations were generally walled off, and the majority of a city states population would live within those walls. When the first city states emerged around 3000 BCE, there was constant conflict, although not over religion, but over property.

Akkad gave us the idea of hostages and slaves, as they would frequently take the population of conquered cities captive. Akkad would also disperse its governors into different parts of Mesopotamia, using them to keep its control.

                    The Sumerians ruled from 2100 BCE to 2000 BCE, and were techincally the third dynasty of Ur. Sumer created the first code of law, which was not that of Hammurabi, nor was it nearly as complex. Sumer was also significant for developing ziggurats, stepped pyramids that served as complex focal points of worship. Sumer also is known for the first communication network through a system of messengers.

                    Babylon was <em>the</em> Mesopotamian kingdom, the most important center of rule out of all the city states that existed. This is so due to Babylon's standardization of language and writing, basically the idea of a national language. The temples of Babylon dwarfed its predecessors at Ur. The Babylonians heavily improved on almost everything the Sumerians did. Not to mention the Code of Hammurabi, which was created by the Babylonian king Hammurabi.

                <h2>The Code of Hammurabi</h2>
                <p>
                    Although it was not the first code of laws, the Code of Hammurabi is the earliest surviving code of such complexity. It was developed about 300 years after the code of Ur Nammu in Ur in 1790 BCE. Before Hammurabi's code, however, there were judges, but no set of pre-defined laws. Each judge would have their own concept of right and wrong, meaning you could be killed for something another judge would just cut your hand off for. Originally kings would do the task of judging, but at one point they felt it beneath them and started to delegate it. Then in comes Hammurabi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hammurabi wrote a code of 282 different laws, inscribed on a large stone pillar, called a stele, in the center of his city for all his people to see. There were laws for commerce, which regulated trade and prices, laws for liability, that upheld personal accountability, such as if an animal died in a stable accident, it was the stable owner's fault. There were laws regarding inheritance, which was heavily regulated, deciding which son would get what. Then of course there were the laws for crimes, such as the punishments for hitting someone or theft. The code even considered the idea of emancipation, of how a slave could be free and what would happen to them once freed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hammurabi's laws provided stability for his people, preventing the hindering of trade and kept his empire going. Hammurabi recognized the need for laws in order to maintain a strong civilization, and also that he needed to make the rules. If the king decided what was just, the people would look to the king for guidance, and the king gets to decide how to run his empire, giving him even more power.

                    Like all other major civilization, Mesopotamia had a rich culture and mythology, recorded in their epic poems. The most famous of the Mesopotamian epics is the Epic of Gilgamesh, the king of Uruk. The epic had the first definition of good and evil, civilized and barbarian, and at its base it was just a good story. The epic defines the basic story stype, the hero's journey, that has been used so widely throughout history.

                    The epic was written down somewhere around 2750 BCE, but was passed down orally for hundreds, maybe thousands of years before. The date 2750 is simply the date of copy that has been studied. The definition of a standard epic poem is a long poem that tells a story about a hero. Epics tell us a lot about the society they come from, as the hero is the ideal member of that society, and shows what the society values. In the case of Gilgamesh, he was the son of a king and a goddess, 1/3 man and 2/3 god. He was strong, beautiful, wise, aspects that Mesopotamians evidently strived for. In the epic, Gilgamesh comes upon the beast known as Enkidu, created by the gods to defeat Gilgamesh. Enkidu was everything Gilgamesh was notL ugly, barbarian, savage. However, Gilgamesh took him in and befriended him, and introduced him to civilization (coincidentally that introduction involved a prostiture). Enkidu then drinks beer and eats bread, gets bathed, and wears clothes, his understanding broadening with each experience.

                    The story also tells that the Mesopotamians valued music, agriculture, religion, buildings, and possibly prostitutes, but take that last one with a grain of salt. After Enkidu's experiences, he and Gilgamesh become close friends, some interpretations go so far as to call them lovers. Enkidu's final stage of civilization involved donning bronze armor, and traveling with Gilgamesh to kill a monster so that they can cut down a great cedar tree in order to make a holy door for the city of Nippur. Again, it shows a Mesopotamian value, this one saying that civilized people work together, not fight each other.

                    Later in the Epic, the goddess of love Ishtar wants to wed Gilgamesh, but the king knew of the goddess' tendencies to be a wee bit crazy, and so denied her. Ishtar complained to her parents, asking for the heavenly bull to kill Gilgamesh. However, Gilgamesh and Enkidu together defeat it. But killing the holy bull greatly offended the gods, so they struck down Enkidu as punishment, leaving Gilgamesh to mourn for months, until maggots came from the corpse's nose. This showed that even the mighty Gilgamesh wasn't above the jurisdiction of the gods.

                    After his grieving, Gilgamesh becomes aware of his own mortality, and sets out to find Utnapishtim, a man known to be immortal. Gilgamesh crosses the sea of death to reach him, and once there Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh a story of the great flood, the first reference in ancient history to a great flood. This again shows the all powerful nature of the gods. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh that he can't become immortal, but upon seeing his despair, he gives him the sacred plant of immortality. Overjoyed, Gilgamesh traveled back to his city to share his story, stopping along the river to take a break. Alas, during this break, a serpent stole the plant, leaving Gilgamesh crushed and asking the gods why. The moon god responds to him, telling him that his name will live forever, so while his body will wither away, he will still be immortal.

                <h2>Influence of Gilgamesh</h2>
                <p>
                    The epic of Gilgamesh was the first to introduce the concept of a great flood, which is repeated in the Bible with the story of Noah and his ark. The epic set the formula for the hero's journey, which can be seen anywhere from Odysseus to Star wars. It also featured an evil serpent, again repeated in the Bible with Adam and Eve and the serpent in Eden. The religion in Gilgamesh is also very similar to those of Egypt, Greece, and Rome. The epic also introduced the idea of anthropomorphism, which is giving human qualities to animals and inanimate objects. Finally, the epic established the importance of clay, as it believed it to be the substance of life, and clay was used for everything: soil, writing tablets, walls, the idea that life came from it, so people had to as well.

                <p>
                    Joseph Campbell is the man who defined the hero's journey as set by epics like that of Gilgamesh, as well as stating that myth served four main functions in the ancient world. He said that they invoked a sense of awe in those that read/heard them. They presented an image of the cosmos, the what and why of nature. They justified a social order/hierarchy. And finally they would carry humanity through the stages of life, from birth to death.

                <h2>Mesopotamian Values and Religion</h2>
                <p>
                    The Mesopotamians valued water, agriculture, community, elders, appeasing the gods, respecting the dead, and ancestor worship. Their religions were the origins of the Big Three, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Around 3000 BCE, there was relative stability, allowing for the creation of the primary sources. Those sources included the Enuma Elish (2700 - 2000 BCE) and the Epic of Atrahsis which told how the gods, world, and humanity came to be. There was also Table XI of Gilgamesh, from the 12th century BCE. It involved humans interacting with gods. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Sumerians in 3000 BCE created a cosmology that gave order to their universe, saying that it was a dome underwater. Sumerian religion was polytheisitic and hierarchical, with each city state having its own local god. They believed that the humans were made of clay and were made as servants to the gods, and so had to follow the moral codes of the gods. The Sumerians valued fertility, protection, wisdom, and reverence for the earth. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea of syncretism is mixing together aspects of different cultures together into one. This is very important in ancient civilizations, as it is seen everywhere. It's seen as early as 3000 BCE. The deifying of priest-kings was as early as 2300 BCE. The primary Mesopotamian god was Marduk, first seen around 2000 BCE. The god Assur, seen around 2000 - 1500 BCE, replaced Marduk as the primary god, and resembles Yahweh. Finally, monotheism started to crop up around 1000 BCE with Judaism and Zoroastrianism.
