                <h2>Overview of the Persian Empire</h2>
                <p>
                    Around 2000 BCE, a group of people split up, forming two distinct groups, the Aryans and the Persians. The Persians remained in Mesopotamia, while the Aryans moved into the Southeast and India. Some of the great Persian leaders were Cyrus the Great, Cambyses, and Darius I the Great. The first, Cyrus, defeated the Medes and Babylonians, and in doing so established the greatest empire that the world had ever seen. Cambyses was his son, and extended the Persian empire by conquering Egypt in 525 BCE. Finally, Darius I ruled from 522 to 486 BCE, and had a peaceful, tolerant, and prosperous rule. This was due to his use of roads for military, communication, and trade, as well as his satropies. Satropies were the Persian equivalent to provinces, each one ruled by a satrap, or governor. Each satrap was appointed by Darius, and would deal with their own local area. However, from time to time they would get too powerful and revolt. To counter this, Darius had local garrisons in each satropy that held soldiers loyal only to him and would enforce his well if any satrap started to deviate. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Darius' system, althought wildly succesful for him, required a strong leader to be maintained. After the death of Xerxes I in 464 BCE, Persia endured a series of weak kings, allowing conquered countries like Egypt to revolt. The weak kings, unable to deal with the revolutions, attempted to solve them by raising taxes, further causing problems, until the empire became exceedingly weak. In 330 BCE, Alexander the Great, the Macedonian king, conquered Persia. Between 220 and 650 CE, there was a brief revival of Persian power under the Sassanid Dynasty, and Persian culture was preserved quite well even after being passed to Muslim kings.

                <h2>Herodotus</h2>
                <p>
                    Herodotus was the world's first historian, born in Halicarnassus in the 5th century BCE. He was a Greek historian, writer, and storyteller, and is known as the father of history. Over the course of his life, Herodotus wrote a series of nine books called Historie, a word from ancient Greek meaning to inquire or to ask, and became the word we use today for History. Almost everything we know about the Persians was written by Herodotus.

                <h2>The Medes</h2>
                <p>
                    The Medes were first mentioned in Assyrian records from around the 9th century BCE. The Medes came to Mesopotamian from western modern day Iran. The kingdom was called the Media or the Median Empire. and during the time of the Assyrians, the Median king Cyaxeres (625 - 585 BCE) successfully conquered the Assyirian capital of Nineveh. After that, he allied with the Babylonians, and later took Ashur, the religious center of the Assyrians.

                <h2>The Lydians</h2>
                <p>
                    Even to this day, the origins of the Lydians remain unknown. What little we do know we owe to Herodotus. Lydia was ruled by three dynasties, the Atyads, the Heraclids-Tylonids, and the Mermnads. King Alyattes (610 - 560 BCE) was a Mermnad king, and made Lydia one of the most powerful city states at the time. He allied with the Greeks to defend against the Medes. However, the Lydians and the Medes made a peace treaty after a great battle at the river Halys in 585 BCE. According to Herodotus, an eclipse occured during the battle, and so the two sides took it as a sign from God and laid down their weapons. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lydia is also known for creating the world's first coined money. The idea was made by King Ardys of Lydia (652 - 615 BCE), who established a mint in the Lydian capital of Sardis. The mint produced coins of electrum, an alloy made of gold and silver. Croesus succeeded Alyattes as king of Lydia from 560 to 546 BCE, and during his reign, Lydia reached its greatest size and wealth. The name Croesus became synonymous with wealth, and this begat the phrase "rich as Croesus."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Croesus is also credited with building the temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. It was located in the ancient city of Ephesus, south of the modern city of Iznir in Turkey. Artemis was the Greek goddess of hunting, and the temple was brought about due to the Lydian alliance with the Greeks. The alliance led to a diffusion of Greek culture and belief in the Lydians, and so they made the temple.

                <h2>Cyrus the Great</h2>
                <p>
                    Cyrus the great ruled from 559 - 530 BCE, and was the first Persian king. He created an empire extending from Anatolia to the Persian gulf, and brought together all the former empires of Assyria and Babylonia. Cyrus was the son of a Mede princess and a Persian noble, and his birth was the start of the Achaemenid dynasty. He began ruling Mede in 550 BCE. 
                </p>
                 <p>
                     According to Herodotus, Cyrus succeeded his father Cambyses the Elder as King of Anshan. At that point, it was still a vassal of Mede. Cyrus' maternal grandfather was Astyages, the son of Cyaxeres, the conquerer of the Assyrians. When Cyrus was still a child, Astyages was said to have had a dream that he would be defeated by his grandson. Astyages, not wanting to be killed, told his steward to kill the wee baby Cyrus, but the steward, Harpagus, did not. Astyages, instead of killing Cyrus himself, allowed the child to live, and instead killed the son of Harpagus, serving the boy's head to Harpagus on a plate. Harpagus wanted revenge, so when Cyrus was older, he helped him conquer Ecbatana, the Capital of Media, and so when Astyages fell, Cyrus became the king of all Persia.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     Cyrus attacked Croesus of Lydia, Nabonidus of Babylon, and then Amasis II of Egypt, all who fell before him. He attacked Croesus first as he knew Lydia was a rich city state, so if he took it, he could fund his future war efforts. He defeated Croesus at Pterium and captured him, and then Persia occupied the capital of Sardis in 546 BCE. In 538 BCE, Cyrus defeated Nabonidus, and Cyrus assumed the title: "King of Babylon, King of Sumer and Akkad, King of the Four Sides of the World." Cyrus' son Cambyses went on to conquer Egypt in 525 BCE, taking on the role of Pharaoh.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     When Cyrus conquered Babylon, one of his first deeds was to free the Jews to return to Israel. He wrote a declaration for the rights of all people in his lands on a clay barrel known as the Cyrus Cylinder. It included stories of his victories, merciful acts, royal lineages, and the rights of all the people. The cylinder has sometimes been called the first charter of human rights. The cylinder was discovered in 1879 in Babylon, and is currently kept in the British Museum, and in 1971, the UN translated it into all of its official languages.

                <h2>The Scythians</h2>
                <p>
                    The first record of the Scythians is from the 7th century, and they allied themselves with the Assyrians against the Cimmerians. The Scythian King Partatua married an Assyrian princess in 674 BCE and the two kingdoms remained allies afterwards. Together, the Scythians and the Assyrians fought the Medes, but later, the Medes were able to drive the Scythians out of Mesopotamia and north into Russia. According to Herodotus, in 514 BCE, Darius, the third of the Persian great kings, decided to invade to Scythia. Darius marched the Persian army, 700,000 strong, across the Danube to the Russian steppes. The Scythians did not fight the Persians directly, but instead through small raids and guerilla warfare. Darius was forced to retreat. The Scythians are credited for being some of the first people to domesticate and ride horses, and also for the development of bridles and saddles (but not stirrups). The Scythians were a shamanistic people who believed in the spirit world, amulets, and ancestor worship. They had no cities or monuments, no temples or religious images. Within Scythian tribes, the Shamans held the most power.
