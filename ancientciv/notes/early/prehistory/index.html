                <h2>Great Leap Forward</h2>
                <p>
                    Coined by Jared Diamond, the Great Leap forward was an event that took place roughly 35,000 years ago. It marks a fundamental change in human anatomy that encompassed changes in skeletal structure, vision, and brain function. Human thumbs became opposable, allowing for the use of items in ways that previous primates could not accomplish. The human cranial pan became larger and heavier, allowing for a bigger brain and increased capacity for thought. Directly related to this was a strengthening of the spine and erectness of the spine to support the larger cranial pan. Human hips also became wider, allowing for lateral movement such as sidestepping. The larger hips also begat a longer gestation time and a decreased ability to move for females, beginning the inequity between the genders. In the case of vision, human eyes became more binocular in nature, allowing for better three dimensional vision and differentiating between the near and far. With the increase in brain function, human pattern recognition greatly improved.

                <h2>Forest to the Farm</h2>
                <p>
                    The Forest to the Farm was the movement of human civilization from a nomadic species into an agricultural one. Humans particularly settled in the area known as the Fertile Crescent, which experienced hot dry summers and was home to hard, large self-pollinating seeds. The conditions in the crescent around 10,000 BCE were perfect for the advent of agriculture, with the middle eastern climate being hotter and wetter than it is now. With farming as the new steady source of food, villages began to develop around structures such as trash heaps, which would serve as compost, and in turn lead to better crops. As permanent villages with stable grain supplies started to become the norm, humans had less travel and population control, leading to an increased population size. Young children could now eat grains, which was easier for them to process than meat, allowing for a shorter weaning period and more frequent pregnancies. This huge change in social structure and population was known as the Neolithic Revolution, which took place approximately 10,000-7,000 years ago. Simply put, the revolution was a movement from a hunter/gatherer lifestyle to that of agriculture and farming.

                <h2>The Stone Age</h2>
                <p>
                    Evidence of the stone age can be found in a variety of areas, one such being the valley of Somme. During 1841 and 1853, the oldest remains of civilizations were found in the form of sharp flint instruments and cattle, deer, and elephant bones. Based on this evidence, it has been determined that the flint was cut around 5,000 years ago by humans, however there were species that lived around 200,000 years ago. In the banks of Vezere, remains of ancient humans were found in a cavern, coining the phrase caveman. Within the cavern were also skeletons, weapons, tools, and other evidence that such places were used as habitations and graves. There was also evidence that humans at the time knew how to use flint to create fires.

                <h2>The Polished Stone Age</h2>
                <p>
                    This time period featured lake dwellings built over water and domesticated animals such as sheep, goats, oxen and dogs. The humans at this time would have hunted animals like deer, boar, and elk. They also were capable of sewing, pottery, and farming, and created polished stone tools that were much more effective than their predecessors. During this time, giant stone monuments were used as tombs and pieces in religious ceremonies.

                <h2>The Bronze Age</h2>
                <p>
                    The bronze age was highlighted by the use of bronze, an alloy of copper of tin, throughout human tools. Copper was easily found in nature, and did not require excessive heat to be moldable. The bronze made was used for everything, from knives and swords to bracelets and brooches. Many of these bronze artifacts were found in mounds throughout Europe, as well as dolmens, the turf pits of Denmark, and rock tombs. Usually when found, gold would be nearby, and in rare cases even woolen garments. However all these artifacts originate from the same age, before the Romans entered Gaul. Despite its widespread use, no record of the inventor of bronze has been found.

                <h2>The Iron Age</h2>
                <p>
                    The use of iron began in Europe before the Roman Empire. The metal was much harder to smelt and work with than bronze, but was much stronger and well worth the extra effort. Iron was mainly used in the production of weapons such as axes and swords, and said weapons were generally buried with the warriors who wielded them. Like that of bronze, iron tools and ornaments were typically found with gold and silver.

                <h2>Civilization</h2>
                <p>
                    Human kind has existed on Earth for a very long, despite having only organized itself during the last 10,000 years. Even then, civilization was a very gradual process, as it was not uniform throughout the world, and happened at different paces in different places. But no matter where, each age of civilization is exponentially shorter than the last, as advances in technology also increase the speed at which better technology is developed. For example, the current silicon age has only been around for about a 100 years and here you are reading this on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, civilization is the order that separates us from animals and plants. The roots of civilization came from the city and citizen, as people recognized themselves as belonging to some sort of culture that had a center to congregate around. An example of this was the civilization of the ancient Greeks, who would separate themselves from what they called barbarians (due to the way they would speak).

                    The former took place roughly 10 - 7,000 years ago, and was based around the migration from the forest to the farm, as well as the development of the first permanent villages. The latter was much more recent, around 7 - 5,000 years ago, and was focused on the growth of ancient cities.
