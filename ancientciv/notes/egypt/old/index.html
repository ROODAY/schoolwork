                <p>
                    The Predynastic period was the span of time from 5500 - 3100 BCE, and saw the development of Egyptian city states, called Nomes. The Nomes had lots of irrigation projects, reflecting the intrinsically hydraulic nature of Egypt. However, during this time, there was no unity between the nomes as they would constantly fight over land and water. However, within each Nome, there were government organized developments, generally regarding agriculture, religion, and the development of written languages, specifically hieroglyphics. Nomes also saw the first tombs and an emphasis on the afterlife. Near the end of the Predynastic period, all the Nomes, and really the regions of upper and lower Egypt, were unified by the mythical historical figure King Menes, possibly the figure of King Narmer, around 3100 BCE. Menes was an example of syncretism in ancient civilizations as he had the features of many different kings in one.

                <h2>Introduction to Old Kingdom</h2>
                <p>
                    The Old Kingdom was between 2850 and 2150 BCE, and was characterized by a very strong, centralized government, among other things. This government developed irrigation systems as well as offered protection for its people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pharaohs of the Old Kingdom were god kings, the mouthpieces of heaven. Whereas normal kings were just the best of the people, pharaohs were appointed by the gods, spoke for the gods, and when pharaohs died, they went to the gods. Most of the pyramids that remain today are the tombs constructe for Old Kingdom pharaohs. Because of the geography of Egypt, the pharaoh was forced to separate the priests and nobles and spread them out all over the kingdom while he remained stationary in the capital. This led to the regions of those priests and nobles to become independent and rebel, a constant problem for the pharoahs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The massive pyramid projects that the pharaohs kept constructing were a huge expense. They cost the country a lot of its resources, as well as being a huge burden on the people. When the low flood period occured between 2250 and 1950 BCE, it became too much for the people to handle and the Old Kingdom fell apart.

                <h2>Phases of the Old Kingdom</h2>
                <p>
                    There were two major phases to the Old Kingdom, the early dynastic period and the old kingdom period. Much of the former is mainly myth, composed of 3 competing Kings, called the Crocodile King, the Scorpion King, and the King of Ka. Those three fought over resources like land and water, and were defined by their aggresiveness. Nearly every depiction of them involved them killing their enemies. However, it is hard to verify these three kings, so they are regarded as generally mythical figures. The little that we know about these kings comes from the heads of maces and serekhs, royal engravings of their names.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Around 3100 BCE, Egypt was unified under King Narmer/Menes, a man known throughout Egypt and Canaan. The first administrative center of the newly unified Egypt was at Memphis. Under Narmer, Egypt was over 600 miles long, but only a few miles wide, following the Nile Valley. The royal palaces, cemeteries, and priests were located at Abydos, which later became a site of religious pilgrimage. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this unification, the former Nomes became administrative districts, 42 in all. Each one had its own leader/governor, and were the counterparts to the Persian satropies. The districts provided for organization, commerce, communication, and all the things that would be needed to rule a city.

                <h2>Scribes of Egypt</h2>
                <p>
                    Scribes were one of the most important parts of Egyptian society, just below the Pharaohs and priests. Scribes were like jacks of all trades, as they did basically everything related to writing and records. The scribes were the government workers and planners. They were everything from doctors, lawyers, accountants, teachers, surveyors, engineers, and architects. The scribes also had a special school that would be used for their training, located in Thebes. However, due to the proliferation of scribes, they often gained a lot of power, causing trouble for the Pharaoh.

                <h2>People of Egypt</h2>
                <p>
                    Even after unification, Egyptians still considered themselves to be a people of two lands, Upper and Lower Egypt. There were even separate crowns for pharaohs of the different regions. But no matter their region, the pharoahs had to have beards. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the second half of the Old Kingdom, Egypt was ruled by King Djoser. This was around 2664 BCE, and he was considered to be the one of the first kings to be considered a god. Back then, only gods could go to the afterlife, meaning there was no hope of eternal paradise for the common people. In the Old Kingdom, Pharaohs were also the absolute rulers of Egypt, having absolute control of everything, even the flooding of the nile and the outputs of harvests. This was why the people would revolt if they did not get good floods, as it meant that their pharaoh was failing them. Djoser is also considered to be the first historical figure in the line of Pharaohs as there is a lot of evidence and information about him. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Djoser also is credited for creating the first pyramid as we know them to be. During the third dynasty of the Old Kingdom, Djoser commissioned his chancellor Imhotep to design a pyramid for him. It was called the staircase to heaven, as it was a step pyramid, and the first stone monument of its type. Imhotep is also credited with inventing the stone column, as well as special interior walls that would hold the weight of the pyramid above it. His work was so magnificent that we was made the god of medicine after his death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sekhemet, the son of Djoser, made his step pyramid wrong and was forced to halt the contruction. Another pharaoh, Amenemhat I, made a pyramid at Lisht, near El Fayum in Lower Egypt. Sneferu's pyramid at Meidum was 590 feet tall and 656 feet wide. In total, Sneferu had two enormous pyramids built for him, the North and South Stone pyramids. Sneferu was also the first pharaoh to fill in the steps of the pyramid to give them smooth sides.

                <h2>Fall of Old Kingdom</h2>
                <p>
                    The Old Kingdom was a theocratic system burdened by pyramids. The fact that the wealth of all Egypt belonged to the Pharaoh was another problem. Together, they brought on the fall of the Old Kingdom, which was quickened by a multitude of other factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Egyptians believed in polygamy, which led to inheritance issues when the pharaoh died. There would be arguments over which wife was the best, or whose son would be pharoah. Then there would be the issues of how to disperse authority. As Egypt's economy would worsen with the low floods and the pharaoh's wasting of resources, the people would lose faith in him and begin to question his divinity, leading to chaos, and ultimately the first intermediate period. Pepi II, the last king of the fourth dynasty, had very little power over his people, and with his death, so died the Old Kingdom.

                <h2>The First Intermediate Period</h2>
                <p>
                    The First Intermediate period was between 2190 and 2052 BCE. It was marked by chaos, as there was no central authority, and civil war between the nomes. The economy worsened and worsened as trade became impossible due to pirates. However, there were still some achievements during this time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the south, the kings created a new capital, Heracliopolis, and there was exploration further south. Religion was reorganized, and literacy rates increased. To the north, Thebes became the dominant city. The unification that made the Old Kingdom so great started to dissolve, and once again Egypt became feudal, as local administrators started to become local kings. The nomes were all self ruling, and although the city of Heracleopolis became the most powerful, it was not powerful enough to reunite Egypt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the intermediate period, beliefs in the afterlife changed as well. No longer was the pharaoah the only one capable of attaining eternal peace, as now anyone who followed the moral codes could do so. Wealthy men began to build monuments for themselves, and the king was no longer believed to be a god. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Between 2200 and 2100 BCE was the hundred years of chaos, an account of which was found in a 19th dynasty historical report titled Admonitions of Ipuwer, which told how men would wait in the reeds for unfortunate travelers that they could rob. During this time, no one would sail to the north to trade with Byblos as it was too dangerous to travel. There would be groups of armed men who roam the lands and patrol the seas. The other kingdoms and states around Egypt grew powerful and invaded. The Egyptians became so poor that the dead were simply thrown into the Nile. It was written that the crocodiles inhabiting the Nile became so bloated with dead men that they sank of their own weight, and that laughter had dissapeared from the land, replaced with wailing and sorrow.

                <h2>Pyramids</h2>
                <p>
                    Every summer when pyramids were being built, royal officials would travel down along the Nile to collect young men to work on the monuments. They young men would never go back home. In Egyptian myth, there was nothing but watery chaos in the beginning. Then dry land emerged in the shape of a pyramid, which explains the monuments' significance. It symbolized life and so was used for the tombs of kings so that they could be carried to the afterlife. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2480 BCE, Khufu made a pyramid that used the stars to be oriented. The Egyptians used a plumb line to do so, and it was nearly perfect. The architects planned for a flat base, and to keep adding smaller and smaller sections on the top. The workers were given food for working, something they weren't used to as they would have to catch it themselves or starve back home. Every worker had a place and purpose during work on pyramids, and this was necessary as there was over 5 million tons of stone needed for the pyramid. Most of it was quarried on site in Giza. 1,500 were there just for quarrying, using copper chisels and hammers. Then there were specialists like chisel sharpeners to keep the workflow going. Scribes would mark blocks so the workers knew where to place them, and the blocks were moved by gangs of workers dragging it through sand, which would be wet with water to make sliding easier. The gangs were told to compete as the fastest would get rewards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pyramid at Giza had 3 burial chambers: one below the pyramid, one inside it, and another large gallery area. There was a compound named after Khufu that held his elite workers and their children, who were their apprentices. These elites got luxuries that the normal workers would never see. Some of the elites were carvers, who used set-squares to make sure the right angles were exact. At any one time, there would be around 25,000 workers on the pyramid. There were also 9 masssive granite blocks, 50 tons each, that were imported from over 500 miles away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inside the nooks and crannies of the pyramid, lots of graffiti was found. After all the steps were placed, they were filled in and smoothed for a gleaming finish. The pyramid for Khufu had 3 smaller ones in its shadow for his queens, and to the east there was a causeway and a temple that was used for his burial rituals. Khufu wasn't buried with a lot of riches, as that was a fad of the New Kingdom. But all the pyramids would have a shaft going from the tomb chamber out to the circumpolar stars, what the Egyptians called the indestructibles.
