                <h2>Introduction to New Kingdom</h2>
                <p>
                    The New Kingdom was between 1570 and 1085 BCE, beginning with expansion to protect the kingdom from future invasions. The Egyptians took over Nubia, a land rich with gold and minerals, and turned it into a military state with fortresses and garrisons along the Nile, tightening their control over it. Egypt had less direct control of Syria and Palestine, basically leaving them to their own devices as long as they continued to pay tribute. However, to maintain control of them, Egypt made use of the hostage system, in which they would take the sons of the kings and hold them captive to keep the other cities in check. While holding them captive, they would teach them Egyptian ways, so that when they were older and went back to rule, they would rule their cities in a way beneficial to Egypt. Also during this time, the Priests of Amon became very powerful, and there was a point where they controlled about 30% of Egyptian land.

                <h2>The Hyksos</h2>
                <p>
                    Before the New Kingdom, near the end of the Second Intermediate Period, Egypt was on the verge of extinction. A foreign king invaded in the North and declared himself Pharaoh. This king was of the Hyksos. Under his rule, the Egyptian cities and royal line fell on hard times, leading to the king of Thebes and his sons plotting to defeat the Hyksos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the Thebian king and his sons Ahmose and Kamose wanted to get rid of the Hyksos, many people were doing pretty well under the Hyksos and weren't very unhappy. But the fact that Egypt was ruled by another country was against its values, so when Kamose intercepted a message from Hyksos to the Nubians asking them to help crush Egypt, he used it as a rallying point to get support from the people. Kamose died in battle, leaving Ahmose, groomed for war and rule by his mother, to finish the fight. After the war, Ahmose was hailed as a hero, and became pharaoh.

                <h2>Hatshepsut</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1903, while working in the Valley of the Kings, Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Hatshepsut, one of the few female pharaohs, who was wiped from historical records by her son. When her husband died, her son Tuthomosis III became pharaoh, but he was but a child and too young to rule, so she became co-ruler. This in and of itself isn't that special, but that fact the she declared herself king and presented herself as a pharaoh is. Before her, there were only two female pharaohs, but they did not rule for nearly as long as her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Egyptian women were generally housewives, ladies of the house, and were treated better than their counterparts in other parts of the world. However, they were still second class citizens and had to bow to the will of men. Egyptians believed in an idea called maat, their order of the universe, part of which was that men had to rule. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hatshepsut claimed that he father appointed her in his place after his death, and completely embraced her beauty. She claimed that her father was really a god in disguise, and therefore had the power to name her pharaoh, even though she was a woman. But she still understood that the people had been too accustomed to having male rulers, so she always had her public likeness depcited as a man.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hatshepsut had a male acquaintance called Serimut, who rose up from being a commoner to a high position in her court. People questioned their relationship, with rumors of their romantic involvement. Hatshepsut trusted Serimut with the construction of her tomb, as well as taking care of her daughter, as well constructing obelisks/monuments in her name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Tuthomosis grew older, he set his sights on the throne, so to keep him occupied, Hatshepsut sent him and the army on an expedition to a land they hadn't been to in 500 years. The expedition was a total successm and the army brought back great luxuries, making Hatshepsut even more popular. But having been delayed from his throne for so long, when Tuthomosis eventually took power, he struck his mother's name from all the records he could, and act with the significance of destroying her chances of reaching the afterlife.

                <h2>Tuthomosis III</h2>
                <p>
                    When Tuthomosis came into power, his enemies thought he would be weak, since he had no experience ruling. New princes and kings from other countries attempted to take over at this point, but they made a grave mistake. Tuthomosis had been expecting such a thing and had prepared himself for the twenty years he waited for the throne, and quickly fought back his attackers, expanding into their territory, and growing Egypt.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tuthomosis planned to make the first Egyptian empire, and to do so, he needed lots of soldiers. He created big recruitment campaigns to get soldiers to join voluntary, and when they didn't, he would force them anyway. Unlike his mother, who let him and other officials lead the army, Tuthomosis led his army by himself. He had scribes record absolutely everything, from the number of troops and resources to just day to day life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once Tuthomosis amassed his army, he set his sights on Migeeto, a city that was worth a thousand. Once he arrived there, he quickly decimated his foes, but on the verge of victory his plan fell to pieces. Instead of pushing towards the enemy while they had an advantage, Tuthomosis' soldiers constantly stopped to plunder the cities they ravaged, allowing their enemies to regroup and fortify. This forced Tuthomosis to lay siege to the city, surrounding it and waiting till they ran out of resources. Seven months later, his enemies gave in. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, Tuthomosis realized his vision of an Egyptian empire, creating one that spanned Syria, Nubia, Palestine and Israel. He used a hostage system to keep his occupied city states in line, and when he released the sons of their kings back to their homes, they would've been educated so that their interests would align with that of Egypt. With so much land under his control, Tuthomosis III had become the richest pharaoh yet.

            <div class="section" id="amenhotep">
                <h2>Amenhotep III</h2>
                <p>
                    When Amenhotep III, whose name means "The God Amen is Satisfied", came into power, Egypt was the most powerful and feared nation on the planet. There were no more wars to fight for Egypt, and the country was rich and respected. Amenhotep's challenge as a pharaoh was to maintain this prosperity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This period of time for Egypt was a golden age, and even more so for the pharaoh, as all the empire's wealth belonged to him. Amenhotep maintained such wealth with a strategy hitherto unseen in the ancient world. In 1887 BCE, a peasant was digging for mud bricks and foung rows of well preserved tablets, which turned out to be records of how Amenhotep kept such prosperity. The tablets were records of his correspondences with other leaders, containing words of peace and treaties. Amenhotep used diplomacy to keep Egypt strong, instead of weapons. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the ancient world, the rich could only get richer, and so Amenhotep had ambassadors from all the other nearby nations bring gifts and golds on a frequent basis, and in return, Amenhotep would fund the projects of other kings, be it a new palace or a stronger army. The other kings knew they couldn't take the gold by force, and so had to play Amenhotep's game. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Amenhotep would also marry the daughters of the other kings to solidify his power, but he never let an Egyptian woman marry outside of the kingdom. While he was fine to get pathways into other nations, Amenhotep did not want any of the other kings to have claims to his throne after his death. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For all his success, Amenhotep thanked one god in particular, the king of the gods Amen-Re. Amenhotep would keep giving gold to his priests, accidentally making them more and more powerful. Amenhotep is also credited with making the world's first newspaper system, in the form of clay scarabs. He would have the latest news and achievements of the pharaoh inscribed on them, and they would be distributed throughout the kingdom, further increasing his popularity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Amenhotep's chief wife was Queen Ti, one of the few Egyptian women to be depicted as strong. Amenhotep was so fond of her that he had two massive temples built side by side, one for him and one for her. Near the end of his reign, Amenhotep saw that the priests of Amen were getting too powerful, so he switched to Aten to deprive them of gold.

            <div class="section" id="akhenaten">
                <h2>Akhenaten</h2>
                <p>
                    Akhenaten ruled between 1370 and 1353 BCE, and made radical changes to the way Egypt was run. He outlawed the worship of any god but the Sun God Aten, moved the capital 200 miles north of Thebes to Amarna, disrupting trade and government work, and drastically changed the art style of royal depictions, shaking a lot of his people. With all the changes he made, there was a negative shift in perspective regarding the pharaoh, lessening his status, and letting the power shift to the priests. When the next pharaoh, the young Tutankhamen, took power, he was basically a puppet controlled by the priests and officials. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some saw what Akhenaten did as genius, others saw him as a heretic and a madman. Akhenaten was born Amenhotep IV, but after tragedy struck later in his life, with his mother and two of his children dying and his wife disappearing, he changed his name to Akhenaten and blamed his troubles on Amen. Akhenaten means "Beneficial to Aten". Akhenaten chose a monotheistic approach, unheard of in Egypt, devoting all his attention to Aten. He even went so far as to strike out the name Amen wherever he could, even in records of his father's name. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The art style in Akhenaten's time was more realistic, vibrant, sensual and moody. The bodies would have strange proportions, with elongated heads. The new capital he chose at Amarna was another big change. He forced all his subjects in Thebes to accompany him on the 200 miles trek North, and once there he constructed a new capital 8 miles long and 3 miles wide. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Akhenaten's chief wife was Nefertiti, another of the prominent Egyptian women. She was the first queen to be intimately described by a Pharaoh. But at one point she just disappeared, and when his mother and children died, he started to persecute anyone who worshipped a god other than Aten. He became so consumed in his madness that he didn't notice his empire crumbling around him. Akenaten died in 1336 BCE.

                    Tutankhamen took the throne after Akhenaten at the age of 9. He didn't know how to rule and so was taken advantage of. Tutankhamen was born Tutankhaten, but his name was changed to shift attention away from Akhenaten's mistakes. The priests basically were ruling Egypt at this point, and Tutankhamen was murdered before he could really take control. He was buried with tons of gold, and when Howard Carter found his tomb nearly 2000 years later, Tutankhamen made Egypt famous.

                <h2>Ramses II</h2>
                <p>
                    Ramses II was one of the greatest pharaohs who ever lived, and is known as the last great pharaoh. Ramses led a long and fruitful life, near 67 years of rule (1290 - 1223 BCE), during which he built monuments all over the place. His rule was longer than the average Egyptian's life span. When young Ramses (whose name means "Offspring of RA") took power, Egypt was in a state of uncertainty, as the last king Tutankhamen was murdered young. But Ramses was able to real the kingdom back in. Ramses always would go big or go home, only making massive monuments. Ramses II finished the great Hypostyle Hall at Karnak that his grandfather started years before him. He declared himself the ruler of rulers, the greatest king, and if he saw a monument to another pharaoh that he found impressive, he would etch out their name and replace it with his, making his name all the over pervasive throughout Egypt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The efforts Ramses made at the Hypostyle Hall at Karnak were arguably the greatest feats of engineering and artistic expression in his time. Ramses was also integral to the experience of the Jews in Egypt. They had been living isolated lives for a while now in Egypt, but under Ramses camed the Exodus.

                    Ramses' chief wife, Nefartari, who he married in 1312 BCE, died at the height of his power, and so he made the greatest dedication to her. He had two mountains turned into temples for him and for her. Ramses also outlived many of his children, including 12 sons that he groomed to be pharaoh but died before him.

                    Ramses also had a building called the Rammesium contructed, in which there was the House of Life, a building where his scribes would create propaganda for him. Ramses was a brilliant politician and diplomat, but made for a terrible warrior, making up for it with all his propaganda. In the fifth year of Ramses reign, the Hittites were moving into Egypt's territory, and Ramses fell for a surprisingly simple trick. When he captured a couple of Hittite scouts, they told him the Hittites were far off. Ramses believed them and let down his guard, only to be attacked soon after. If not for his timely reinforcements, Ramses would've died at the battle of Qadesh. But with his scribes and propaganda, he spun it so that it was he that single-handedly saved the day. With all the papyrus plants alongs the Nile for papyrus to record on, the scribes at the House of Life also recorded Egyptian History.

                    After the Battle of Qadesh, Ramses, while telling his people that he easily beat the Hittites, knew that he couldn't fight them off again, so he signed a peace treaty with them, which was solidified with his marriage to a Hittite princess. He made a new capital called Pi-Ramesses in the North, in the Nile Delta. The name meant "The House of Ramesses," and that is where he took his new bride.

                    Ramses died right before the celebration of his 67th year of rule, devastating his people, many of whom were born in his rule and knew no other way of life. Not to mention every pharaoh after Ramses was terrible. Where Ramses had 67 years to complete his works, following pharaohs tried to outdo him in a fraction of the time, putting unneccessary burden on the people and draining Egypt's resources. It was due to this that the world's first industrial strike occured, when the workers refused to work on the new pharaohs' projects. In their anger, the workers looted the burial chambers of kings, leaving them picked clean, and throwing the bodies in caves. Egypt's order started to break down, and the empire collapsed as invasion after invasion struck Egypt, letting Egypt's success die with Ramses.
