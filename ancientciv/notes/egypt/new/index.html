                <h2>Introduction to New Kingdom</h2>
                <p>
                    The New Kingdom was between 1570 and 1085 BCE, beginning with expansion to protect the kingdom from future invasions. The Egyptians took over Nubia, a land rich with gold and minerals, and turned it into a military state with fortresses and garrisons along the Nile, tightening their control over it. Egypt had less direct control of Syria and Palestine, basically leaving them to their own devices as long as they continued to pay tribute. However, to maintain control of them, Egypt made use of the hostage system, in which they would take the sons of the kings and hold them captive to keep the other cities in check. While holding them captive, they would teach them Egyptian ways, so that when they were older and went back to rule, they would rule their cities in a way beneficial to Egypt. Also during this time, the Priests of Amon became very powerful, and there was a point where they controlled about 30% of Egyptian land.

                <h2>The Hyksos</h2>
                <p>
                    Before the New Kingdom, near the end of the Second Intermediate Period, Egypt was on the verge of extinction. A foreign king invaded in the North and declared himself Pharaoh. This king was of the Hyksos. Under his rule, the Egyptian cities and royal line fell on hard times, leading to the king of Thebes and his sons plotting to defeat the Hyksos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the Thebian king and his sons Ahmose and Kamose wanted to get rid of the Hyksos, many people were doing pretty well under the Hyksos and weren't very unhappy. But the fact that Egypt was ruled by another country was against its values, so when Kamose intercepted a message from Hyksos to the Nubians asking them to help crush Egypt, he used it as a rallying point to get support from the people. Kamose died in battle, leaving Ahmose, groomed for war and rule by his mother, to finish the fight. After the war, Ahmose was hailed as a hero, and became pharaoh.

            <div class="section" id="hatshepsut">
                <h2>Hatshepsut</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1903, while working in the Valley of the Kings, Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Hatshepsut, one of the few female pharaohs, who was wiped from historical records by her son. When her husband died, her son Tuthomosis III became pharaoh, but he was but a child and too young to rule, so she became co-ruler. This in and of itself isn't that special, but that fact the she declared herself king and presented herself as a pharaoh is. Before her, there were only two female pharaohs, but they did not rule for nearly as long as her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Egyptian women were generally housewives, ladies of the house, and were treated better than their counterparts in other parts of the world. However, they were still second class citizens and had to bow to the will of men. Egyptians believed in an idea called maat, their order of the universe, part of which was that men had to rule. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hatshepsut claimed that he father appointed her in his place after his death, and completely embraced her beauty. She claimed that her father was really a god in disguise, and therefore had the power to name her pharaoh, even though she was a woman. But she still understood that the people had been too accustomed to having male rulers, so she always had her public likeness depcited as a man.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hatshepsut had a male acquaintance called Serimut, who rose up from being a commoner to a high position in her court. People questioned their relationship, with rumors of their romantic involvement. Hatshepsut trusted Serimut with the construction of her tomb, as well as taking care of her daughter, as well constructing obelisks/monuments in her name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Tuthomosis grew older, he set his sights on the throne, so to keep him occupied, Hatshepsut sent him and the army on an expedition to a land they hadn't been to in 500 years. The expedition was a total successm and the army brought back great luxuries, making Hatshepsut even more popular. But having been delayed from his throne for so long, when Tuthomosis eventually took power, he struck his mother's name from all the records he could, and act with the significance of destroying her chances of reaching the afterlife.
