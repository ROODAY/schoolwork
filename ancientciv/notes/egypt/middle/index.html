                <h2>Introduction to Middle Kingdom</h2>
                <p>
                    The Middle Kingdom was between 2052 and 1778 BCE, and began with the building of new projects and public works. Labyrinths started to be used in tombs as an attempt to confuse burial robbers. This time period also saw the use of booby traps in tombs. Keeping some of the changes in culture from the first intermediate period, the people of the Middle Kingdom believed that more than just the pharaoh could go the afterlife, and he was no longer an all powerful god. But he was still revered as a priest-king. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Middle Kingdom was a time of renewed prosperity and expansion, a veritable cultural golden age, especially in literature. The Kingdom of Egypt increased, as far as Syria and Palestine to the north and Nubia to the south. However, due to the need to stay close to the Nile, there was little lateral expansion. At this point, the kingdom was a 700 mile strip following the Nile, 10 - 15 miles wide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Big Point: <strong>As the Nile Ebbs and flows, so too does the prosperity of the Egyptian civilization.</strong> Regular flooding was prosperous, but too low or too high would lead to chaos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Middle Kingdom saw a new division of power, as the Pharaoh shared more power with the Nomarchs and scribes, and Egypt became much more of a military state. There were even times were the pharaoh would have to ask the nomarchs for things, something that would've been heresy in the Old Kingdom. At this point, the pharaoh has basically been humanized.

                <h2>Changes in the Middle Kingdom</h2>
                <p>
                    The Middle Kingdom was the second great period of Ancient Egyptian culture. During this time, Thebes became the capital and cultural center for all Egypt. Egypt was once again reunited in 2060 BCE, when Mentuhotep II defeated the independent nome at Heracleopolis. He became known as the Pacifier of Two Lands. This reflects the dualistic nature of Egypt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The administration once again gained power and Egypt started to trade again with foreign kindoms. Irrigation projects were repaired and new public works were started, and records started to be kept by scribes again. The scribes started to become more powerful and started to compete with the pharoah.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now with the production of monuments and public works back in full swing, the Pharaohs needed money, and so had to trade or attack the neighboring Bedouins to get gold, copper, gems, granite and limestone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pharaoh that succeeded Mentuhotep III was named Amenemhat I, who moved the capital north to Itj-tawy, near modern day Lisht. He wanted to take full control over Egypt, but was unable to. He conquered Nubia all the way to Elephantine, and tried to take control of the bureaucracy. But the bureaucrats plotted against him, and Amenemhat was assassinated by his wives in what is known as the harem conspiracy.
