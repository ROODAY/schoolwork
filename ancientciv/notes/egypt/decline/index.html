                <h2>Start of Decline</h2>
                <p>
                    By 1085 BCE, Egypt was clearly in decline. It lost possession of Palestine, revolts and raids in Nubia weakened its hold there, and low floods were ruining the economy. The Priests became more powerful than the pharaoh, and the increased reliance on mercenaries was terrible as the pharaoh didn't have the money to pay them. In 940 BCE, the Libyan general Sheshonk forced his way into the royal family through marriage, overthrew his in-laws, and founded the 22nd dynasty. Around 750 BCE, Nubians in the south founded the 25th dynasty, and in 652 BCE, the Assyrian King Ashurbanipal conquered upper and lower Egypt. The Egyptians were able to drive hime and the Assyrians out, but soon after in 525 BCE, the Persian king Cambyses conquered Egypt, and the age of the pharaohs came to an end. From then on, for the next 2400 years, Egypt was passed around from Persia, Macedonia, Rome, Arabia, Turkey, and eventually to Britain before it gained independence again.

                <h2>Libyan Rule</h2>
                <p>
                    In the 1160s BCE, the New Kingdom came to end with the death of Ramses XI. Egypt was in a state of near bankruptcy due to the efforts of the Rammeside kings trying to out do Ramses II. So began the Third Intermediate Period, 1070 - 712 BCE, and again Egypt fell into feudal chaos as the Nomes fought for power. It was during this time that the Libyans came in and took over Egypt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Libyans became a solid threat to Egypt, as they were allies of the Sardinians, Sicilians, Lycians, Etruscans, and Acheans (possibly the Sea People). But the Libyans didn't come to Egypt as conquerors, but as settlers, bringing women, children, oxen, and farm tools so they could start new lives. However, little is known about this time as there were no records or temples built with hieroglyphics to read. Over the years later, Egypt was invaded by the Assyrians, Sea Peoples, the Kushites, basically everyone near them. This was the worst thing for the Egyptians, as after the Hyksos, foreign rule was the worst thing. This period was known as the Late Period, 712 - 332 BCE, some call it the end of Egyptian Civilization.

                <h2>Kingdom of Kush</h2>
                <p>
                    During the decline of Egypt's power, the Kingdom of Kush, in the north of Nubia, gained control of Egypt. The Nubian kings practiced all the same rites and customs as the Egyptian Pharaohs. Kush was the political group of Nubians, but their region was still Nubia, so the Nubians and Kushites were the same people.

                <h2>Assyrian Rule</h2>
                <p>
                    The Assyrian King Ashurbanipal conquered all of Mesopotamia and came in to do the same to Egypt. The first Assyrian invasion pushed the Nubians into Upper Egypt, and a second one in 663 BCE drove them out of Egypt completely. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Assyrians didn't want to control Egypt directly, and so appointed vassal kings from Sais to rule Egypt. This had all the benefits of direct rule but without any effort on the Assyrians' part. The vassal kings were just weak kings who answered to Ashurbanipal and so couldn't do anything, and all of their power came from Assyrian, making them figureheads. When the Assyrians fell, the Sait Kings ruled for a while, some calling this a resurgence of Egypt. However, the Saite kings had to use mercenaries as they couldn't get the people behind them or have the money for their army and projects, so it can't really be called a resurgence.

                    In 612 BCE, Egypt went to war with the Babylonians, but they made peace and an alliance against the PErsians in 568 BCE. This was further evidence of Egypt's decline as it was no longer strong enough to stand on its own.

                <h2>Persian Conquest</h2>
                <p>
                    In 559 BCE, Cyrus the Great rose to power, and under his control the Achaemenid Persian Empire became the largest empire of the ancient world. In 539 BCE, his Cyrus defeated the Babylonians, and in 525 BCE, his son Cambyses defeated the Egyptian army at the Nile Delta. Thus began the Persian Period in Egypt's history, lasting from 525 to 404 BCE.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Persians appointed satraps to rule Egypt, and those satraps declared themselves pharaohs. During their rule of Egypt, the Persian king Darius I started a war with the Greeks, weakening Persia to the point where Egypt could escape its grasp. But the rule of Persia wasn't even that bad for Egypt, as it helped certain people who cared for Egypt to rise to power. But now it at least was independent again, but not for long. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the Persians declined, Egypt started to make a resurgence. Then the Persian King Artaxerxes I re-conquered Egypt. After his death, Egypt became independent again under Pharaoh Nectanebo I of the 30th dynasty. Nectanebo II, the last Egyptian pharaoh, was defeated by Artaxerxes III on 343 BCE.

Having conquered Persia, Alexander moved on to conquer Egypt in 332 BCE. After Alexander's death in 323 BCE, his empire was divided among his generals. Egypt went to the Greek Ptolemy I, who started a Greek dynasty of pharaohs in Egypt. Even so, Egypt remained a very rich region.

                    Ptolemy's dynasty was the Ptolemaic dynasty, which began in 305 BCE, the 32nd dynasty of Egypt. The Ptolemaic dynasty still followed Egyptian customs, following their rituals, worshipping their gods, as well as few Greek ones. But the Ptolemies changed a lot in Egypt. The art style changed from the sleek, perfect representations of the pharaohs to more human-like representations found in the likes of Roman coins. Most of the wives of the Ptolemaic pharaohs were named Cleopatra, Kleos the Greek word for famous, and patris for parents. The famous Cleopatra was Cleopatra VII. The biggest change the Ptolemies made was changing the cultural name of Egypt. Originally, the people called their land Kemet, but after the Ptolemies, the world knew the land as Egypt.

                    To keep control of Egypt, Cleopatra VII asked Julius Casesar, the emperor of Rome, to take control of Egypt, but a year later, in 31 BCE, Cleopatra made an alliance with the Roman general Marc Antony. She wanted to use Antony to free Egypt from Rome, but both she and Antony were defeated by Octavian in 31 BCE in a naval battle, the Battle of Actium. Octavian was a Roman general who later became the emperor Augustus Caesar. Marc Antony and Cleopatra both commited suicide before they were capture, however. It was after this that Egypt became a province to be passed around for millenia.

                <h2>Causes of Decline</h2>
                <p>
                    Due to stagnation from isolation and peace treaties, Egypt stayed the same it was for ages while other civilizations advanced. And without any contact from other civilizations of its own caliber, Egypt forgot how to defend itself, making it easy to conquer. And with issues with flooding, Egypt wasn't able to cultivate its crops and the economy declined. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lot of Egypt's issues stemmed from its geography. Because of where it was, there was already natural isolation keeping other kingdoms, including their culture and ideas, away from Egypt. Because of this isolation, Egypt's resources were limited as it couldn't easily trade for more. Then there was the issue of monuments. With pyramids and monuments, the Pharaohs couldn't go to the afterlife, and so they built tons of them. This was a heavy cost that factored into Egypt's decline. And when the Hebrews, skilled and focused workers for Egypt, were forced out, Egypt lost a lot of productivity. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though Egypt's isolation kept it safe for millenia, when other civilizations eventually surpassed Egypt and invaded, Egypt couldn't hold its own. Even some of Egypt's pharaohs caused its decline. Akhenaten's radical changes to religion, art, and the capital itself shook the faith of many Egyptians. His attempt to remold Egypt in his image weakened the civilization to the point of no return. The brief resurgence under Ramses actually made it worse for Egypt, as all the following Rammeside kings tried to outdo Ramses in a short timeframe, bankrupting Egypt. Some points to consider as the end of Egyptian civilization are: Death of Ramses II, death of Ramses XI, death of Nectanebo II, the start of the Ptolemaic Dynasty, when Egypt became a Roman Province, the last use of hieroglyphics in 400 CE, and even up till 600 CE, the closure of the last polytheistic Egyptian temples.
