                <p>
                    Homer invokes the muse. He begins his story with Odysseus trapped on the island of Calypso, a nymph who wants to take Odysseus as her lover. Athena talks Zeus into pulling strings to set Odysseus free. Then Athena disguises herself to visit Odysseus's son, Tel&eacute;machus in Ithaca. There, she finds out that Odysseus's house is overrun by greedy suitors who have infested the place. They are trying to woo Penelope, Odysseus's wife. Athena advises Tel&eacute;machus to call a council and then travel to nearby islands and seek news of Odysseus's whereabouts.

                    Tel&eacute;machus calls the council and takes the speaker's staff. He denounces the suitors, but Antino&uuml;s blames Penelope for her delaying tactics. The gods send an omen of fighting eagles, which a soothsayer claims indicates Odysseus will soon come home. Eurymachus accuses this prophet of being bribed by Tel&eacute;machus. He states the suitors won't leave until Penelope picks one. Tel&eacute;machus proposes that he be given a ship and crew. He will sail out to seek news. If Odysseus is dead, Penelope will be available for marriage after the funeral is held.

                    Tel&eacute;machus sails to King Nestor at Pylos, who tells him stories of the Trojan War and when Odysseus was last seen. Tel&eacute;machus takes a chariot to travel to Sparta to speak with Menelaus and find further clues.

                    Tel&eacute;machus visits King Menelaus. The King weeps because Tel&eacute;machus resembles Odysseus so much, reminding Menelaus of his lost friend. He and Queen Helen tell more stories of Odysseus's exploits. Meanwhile, at Ithaca, the suitors are arranging to murder Tel&eacute;machus so he won't be able to inherit the throne.

                   The God Hermes, sent by Zeus in Book 1, arrives on Ogygia, where Calypso has trapped Odysseus. He finds Odysseus weeping on the beach, yearning for his family, and he orders Calypso to release him. Odysseus builds a raft from palm trees and sets sail. Poseidon spots Odysseus, and raises sea-storms to shipwreck him.

                    Odysseus tells about Aeolus's gift of a bag filled with winds and about how his curious sailors opened it too early, releasing a wind that blew them off course to Aeolia. His crew next barely escapes from the Island of the Laestrygonians, vicious cannibals. (The Laestrygonians destroy all his men and boats except the one boat Odysseus and a handful of his men are on). The survivors next land at Aeaea, where the witch C&iacute;rc&euml; lives. She lures the scouting party with her bewitching beauty, then uses a wand to transform them into pigs. Only Odysseus escapes because of his suspicious nature. The other crewmen are too terrified to help, but Odysseus uses the magical herb "Moly" to protect himself from magical transformation. When her spells don't affect Odysseus, he threatens her life until she relents and restores his men to human shape. Odysseus then uses his own charms to seduce C&iacute;rc&euml; so she will help him get past the sea-threats ahead. He and his men spend nearly a year with her on the island, and in the end C&iacute;rc&euml; agrees to help Odysseus get home.

His starving crew, however, kill and eat sacred cows belong to Heli&oacute;s (Hyperion or Apollo, the Greek Sun-God). The gods raise storms that drive the boat all the way back to Charybdis. There, Odysseus's ship sinks and his men drown. Only Odysseus thinks quickly enough to save himself, and he washes ashore on Ogygia, where Calypso enslaves him.

                    The generous Phaeacians help Odysseus get home even though this angers Poseidon. Odysseus arrives on Ithaca and disguises himself as a beggar to scout out the land. His kingdom is in shambles. One of his old servants, Eumaeus the swineherd, takes pity on the "bum" and takes him home for a meal. While Eumaeus is not around, Odysseus drops his disguise and reveals himself to Tel&eacute;machus.

                    Odysseus enters the main city. His disguise is so good Penelope and others do not recognize him. Only an aged, toothless, abandoned dog covered with sores, lying in a pile of dung, reacts to Odysseus by wagging its tail. Eumaeus explains that this wretched creature was Argus, once Odysseus's favorite hunting dog. The dog lifts its head, whimpers, and then dies--forcing Odysseus to hide his tears. At the palace, Ant&iacute;no&uuml;s curses the "ragged beggar" and hits him with a footstool. Penelope rebukes Ant&iacute;no&uuml;s and gives the beggar (Odysseus) permission to stay at the palace.

Ant&iacute;no&uuml;s, bored and filled with bloodlust, arranges a boxing match between the two. They are surprised when the wiry Odysseus displays potent muscles by breaking Irus's jaw. Odysseus manages to find out that Melantho, one of the palace maidservants, has become the mistress of Eurymachus, and that the other maidservants are being abused by the suitors.

Penelope declares her decision: she will marry tomorrow whichever suitor can duplicate her husband's feat of shooting an arrow through twelve straight rows of axes after stringing his bow.

                    The contest begins, and the suitors have trouble stringing the bow. In the meantime, Tel&eacute;machus orders all the women in the household to stay in their quarters and out of sight. Eumaeus and Philoetius arrange to remove all weapons from the hall and lock all the doors. Odysseus takes the bow (while being mocked by the suitors) and successfully strings it and shoots through the rows of axes, dumbfounding those watching.

                <h2>Book 24</h2>
                <p>
                    In Hades, the dead spirits of old Greek warriors are surprised at the sudden incursion of so many young men all at once. Agamemnon is greatly impressed by stories of Odysseus's cunning and Penelope's fidelity. The kinsmen of the slain suitors are angry, and they try to revolt. The Ithacan civil war comes to a quick halt, however, when Zeus sends thunderbolts to strike down the rebels. Odysseus resumes his reign as king.
