				<h1>The Milgram Experiment</h1>
				<h3>Is Obedience Universal?</h3>
				<p>
					<small>Created by Brian Bakerman and Rudhra Raveendran</small>
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>The Experiment</h2>
				<p>
					The Milgram Experiment was one of the most famous studies in human psychology of all time. The experiment was created and executed by Stanley Milgram in the early 1960s in an attempt to see how far a person would obey an authority figure.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<section>
					<h2>Background Information</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Who</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>40 male participants between the ages of 20 and 50 in the New Haven Area.</li>
							<li>Participants ranged from unskilled workers to professionals.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>What</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>The willingness of participants to shock "learners," and follow orders.</li>
						</ul>
						
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>When</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>The experiments began in July 1961, a year after the trial of Adolf Eichmann, a former Nazi.</li>
							<li>The procedure itself was carried out in 1963, with variations on the experiment being carried out afterwards.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Where</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Two rooms in the Yale Interaction Laboratory in Yale University.</li>
							<li>One room was for the learner, the other was for the teacher and experimenter.</li>
						</ul>      
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Why</h2>
					<p>
						To answer Milgram's question: 
						<blockquote>
							"Could it be that Eichmann and his million accomplices in the Holocaust were just following orders? Could we call them all accomplices?"
						</blockquote>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>How</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Participants were told to ask the learners questions, and if the learners answered wrong, they were shocked.</li>
							<li>With each subsequent incorrect answer, the voltage of the shock would be increased.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Experiment Objective</h2>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>To see to what degree one would obey authority.</li>
						<li>To also shed light on whether or not Nazi soldiers during the Holocaust could claim to have just been following orders.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Type of Study</h2>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>The Milgram Experiments were non-randomized, single-blind experiments that always put participants in the teacher position to see how they responded to their instructions.</li>
						<li>While the participants were told that the positions of learner and teacher were randomized, it was not so.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<section>
					<h2>Methodology</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Acquiring Subjects</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>The participants were not randomly selected, they were male volunteers who responded to an ad.</li>
							<li>The subjects were between the ages of 30 and 50, and were stratified by their backgrounds.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						The subjects ranged unskilled to professional workers
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Assigning Treatments/Blinding</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>The experiment was single-blinded, as only the participants didn't know what was happening.</li>
							<li>The participants were always assigned to the role of teacher, although they were told otherwise.</li>
							<li>The factors in the experiment were the level of electric shock, the proximity of the experimenter, and over 18 other factors that were manipulated in later variations.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Variations included having the teacher force the learners to be shocked, basically varying the level of involvement the teacher had in the punishment.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Asking Questions</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>The teachers were instructed to ask the learner questions. If the learner answered wrong, they were shocked.</li>
							<li>The learner had responses they were told to make at certain voltages, like pounding on the walls at 300 volts.</li>
							<li>If the teacher refused to continue, they were prompted with four "prods" to keep going, after which if they still wanted to stop, the experiment ended.</li>
						</ul>
						<blockquote>
							<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
								Prod 1: Please continue. or Please go on. 
							</p>
							<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
								Prod 2: The experiment requires that you continue. 
							</p>
							<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">
								Prod 3: It is absolutely essential that you continue. 
							</p>
							<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">
								Prod 4: You have no other choice, you must go on. 
							</p>
						</blockquote>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Each wrong answer increased the voltage, max voltage was 450 volts. At the beginning, each teacher was given a 45 volt sample shock to make them think they were actually shocking people.
					</aside>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Analysis</h2>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Milgram recorded how far particpants would go in the experiment, as in if they would go all the way up to the maximum voltage shock, or if not, when they stopped.</li>
						<li>He originally predicted that most subjects would stop at 150 volts, however, none stopped before 300 volts. 26 out of the 40 total participants went to the final voltage of 450.</li>
						<li>The variations of the experiment, such as one in which the teacher had to physically put the learner's hand on the shock plate, affected the levels of obedience.	</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<aside class="notes">
					Milgram defined defiance as stopping before the 30th shock, and obedience as completing all the shocks.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<section>
					<h2>Conclusions</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Before the experiment, Milgram polled Yale students, as well as his colleagues, and they all thought only a small amount would administer the maximum voltage.</li>
							<li>Due to the results (65% administered the maximum voltage), Milgram came to the conclusion that even ordinary people can commit terrible acts when an authority tells them to.</li>
						</ul>
						<blockquote>
							Ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process. Moreover, even when the destructive effects of their work become patently clear, and they are asked to carry out actions incompatible with fundamental standards of morality, relatively few people have the resources needed to resist authority.
						</blockquote>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Agentic Theory</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Part of Milgram's conclusion was his Agentic Theory. In his theory, he postulated that there were two states of behaviour that a person could be in:
								<ul>
									<li class="fragment"><strong>The Autonomous State</strong>: In which a person directs their own actions and takes responsibility.</li>
									<li class="fragment"><strong>The Agentic State</strong>: In which a person allows others to direct them, and lets them take responsibility for their actions.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Milgram also theorized that there were two conditions necessary for the agentic state to activate:
								<ol>
									<li class="fragment">The person giving orders has to be perceived to be qualified to do so.</li>
									<li class="fragment">The person taking orders has to believe the authority will accept responsibility for their actions.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Things to take away</h2>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment">The experiment was done in response to the Nazi war crimes of World War II.</li>
						<li class="fragment">There were over 18 different variations to the original experiment over the years.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Nearly 3/4 of all the participants of the original experiment administered the full shock. (26 out of 40, or 65% to be exact)</li>
					</ol>
